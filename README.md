# Overview
Machine learning pipeline developed for Bolton laboratory with scripts for model training and inference as well as 
LabNet library to easily adapt code. 
# Background
These scripts were developed to adapt PhaseNet (Zhu et al. 2018) to higher-frequency laboratory data. The backbone
of these scripts were developed using the Seisbench python library and primarily uses the object VariableLengthPhaseNet
which allows for a variable input layer size.
